# Daily Algorithm Practice

Welcome to my Daily Algorithm Practice repository! Here you'll find my solutions to various algorithm problems from different platforms. I aim to improve my problem-solving and coding skills with this daily practice.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is structured as follows:

- Directory named by the date, e.g., `20230715` for July 15, 2023.
- Inside each directory, there will be solutions for that day's practice, each problem will have its own dedicated file.

## Language

The main language used for the solutions is Go.

## Contributing

While this repository is mainly for my personal use, any and all suggestions for problem solutions are welcome. Feel free to create an issue or a pull request, I will review it as soon as possible.
